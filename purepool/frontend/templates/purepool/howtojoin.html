    <h2>Setup</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Download the current Biblepay Client<br>
            <small>Links: <a href="https://www.biblepay.org/" target="_blank">Windows/MacOS</a>,
                          <a href="http://wiki.biblepay.org/Ubuntu_Packages" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>,
                          <a href="https://github.com/biblepay/biblepay" target="_blank">Linux/Other</a></small>
        </li>
        <li>Get the biblepay address wallet address<br>
            <div><small>GUI: Start the client, click on "Receive", then "Request payment". Copy the Address from the popup</small></div>
            <div><small>commandline: biblepay-cli getaccountaddress ""  (or add a number between "" for a new, additional address)</small></div>
            </li>
        <li>Edit your biblepay.conf
          <small>
            On Windows: Open the file explorer and open the address "%appdata%" (press enter). Then go to the directory "BiblePayCore" and edit the file biblepay.conf<br>
            In Linux: Go to the directory ".biblepaycore" in your home directory (~//.biblepaycore/) and edit the file biblepay.conf<br>
            You file should look like this:<br>
            <samp><pre>
                addnode=node.biblepay.org  
                gen=1  
                genproclimit=1
                
                pool={{ POOL_INTERFACE_URL }}
                workerid=[your-biblepay-address-address]
                </pre>
            </samp>
            
            Example:
            <pre>
            <samp>
                addnode=node.biblepay.org  
                gen=1  
                genproclimit=1
                
                pool={{ POOL_INTERFACE_URL }}
                workerid=yQwwRT4NtwBw442eyz37NYTYzyfwxiHLk1
            </samp>
            </pre>
            
            <p>You can change the value genproclimit=1 to a different number, depending on your CPU. Higher numbers are for faster cpus.</p>
            <p>Restart your Biblepay Client and start mining.</p>
          </small>
        </li>
        <li>Start mining!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>You don't even need an account on the pool, everything is done via your biblepay wallet address.</p>
    
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Question: Where is the login/register page for this pool</b><br>
            Answer: There is none. This pools works without accounts, you only need a biblepay address.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question: How can I see, if my client is mining for the pool?</b><br>
            Answer: On Windows/MacOS (GUI clients), go to "Tools" >> "Debug console" and type: "getmininginfo"<br>
            On the commandline, type: "biblepay-cli getminginginfo".
            Both commands should return a list, check "biblepay-generate" and "poolmining" for the value "true"
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question: How many Biblepay coins will I get?</b><br>
            Answer: Your part of every found block depends on how many valid shares your client had submitted.
                    Go to the frontpage and enter your Wallet Address in the input field to see your statistics.<br>
                    Important: These statistics are caches, so it might take some time until you see your data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Question: Will I get the Biblepay coins immediately when a block is found?</b><br>
            Answer: No, first the block must be accepted by the network, we will wait 24 hours for that.
            We will send the biblepay coins once a day, but only if the miner has reached the minimum payout limit.<br/>
            The limits are:<br>
            {% for net, limit in transfer_limits.items %}
              - {{ net }}: {{ limit }} bbp<br>
            {% endfor %}
        </li>        
    </ul>
